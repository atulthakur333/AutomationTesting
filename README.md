# Test_Automation
#The project structure typically consists of the following components: Test Scripts: These are the automated test scripts written using a chosen programming language such as Java and test automation frameworks like Selenium. Test scripts should cover different test scenarios, such as functional tests, regression tests, integration tests, and performance tests.

Test Data: This includes the input data required for executing test scripts. It can be stored in various formats such as JSON, CSV, or Excel files. Test data should cover a wide range of test cases, including positive, negative, and boundary cases.

Test Configuration: This includes the configuration files or settings required to run the test scripts. It may include environment-specific configurations, test settings, or parameters.

Test Reports: These are generated reports that provide detailed information about the test execution results. Reports can be in formats like HTML or PDF and should include information such as test case status, test duration, error logs, and any screenshots or videos captured during the test run.
